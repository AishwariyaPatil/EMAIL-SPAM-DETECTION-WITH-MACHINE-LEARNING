Email Spam Detection Project
This project is focused on detecting email spam using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this task is obtained from Kaggle and contains two columns - v1  and v2.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Python (version 3.6 or above)
Spyder IDE (installed via Anaconda or standalone installation)
scikit-learn (installed via pip or conda)
pandas (installed via pip or conda)
numpy (installed via pip or conda)
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's email spam dataset. It includes email contents and their corresponding labels, where 1 indicates spam and 0 indicates non-spam (ham).

Usage
Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Launch Spyder IDE and open the email_spam_detection.py file.

Run the script to load the email spam dataset, visualize the data, and perform data preprocessing tasks like text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.

Build a machine learning model, such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machine, using scikit-learn.

Train the model on the preprocessed data.

Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Use the trained model to predict whether a new email is spam or not.
